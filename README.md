# vm_party
Here is a place for me to put handy VM related scripts for various ESXI and Docker projects. Some of the scripts will do the following:
* Open a browser for a VM on an ESXI machine
* Create local VMs with Docker and connect them to a remote virtual network (VPN-style)
* Whatever seems useful?

Requirements will be added to requirements.txt and setup will be explained in the near future, once the scripts are working.
